# lafaplugin

Based on [this tutorial](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/How-to-write-a-search-plugin) i made a simple plugin to search torrent files on the site https://top.lafa.site

it doesn't support category search but what i made i found quite useful.

# how-to:
![alt text](https://github.com/MarsBatya/lafaplugin/blob/master/howto.png)
1. go to the **🔍Search** bar in qbittorrent
2. tap on the button **🧩Search plug-ins...** below
3. tap on **Install a new one**
4. choose **Web link**
5. paste this url: `https://github.com/MarsBatya/lafaplugin/blob/master/lafasite.py`
6. tap **OK**

congrats, now you can search torrents and sort them by seeds w/o watching ads on the top.lafa.site
